# Computer Vision Project for Transport Invoice Information Extraction
This repository contains a computer vision project aimed at extracting information from transport invoices and exporting it to an accounting program.

The project includes the following key components:

* **Table Detection with YOLOv8**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for detecting tables within the invoices.

* **Table Structure Recognition with Table-Transformer**: Implements table structure recognition using the Table-Transformer model.

* **OCR with EasyOCR**: Employs EasyOCR for optical character recognition to extract text from the detected tables.
